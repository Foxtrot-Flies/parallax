		<p>Welcome to the North Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles webiste, on this website you will learn how to recieve and keep your Driver's License, vehicle safety, and the story of Brad, a safe driver.</p>
	 <div class="parallax">
	  
	 </div>
		<p>Brad got his permit when he was 15, he then waited six months to get his level two license, then he waited another six months to get his level three! Brad follows the rules of the road to a tee and has never gotten a ticket!</p>
	 <div class="parallax2">
	  </div>
	<p>Brad knows that pedestrians always have the right of way</p>
		<div class="parallax3">
		</div>
	<p>And Brad just got a brand new (to him) 2007 Toyota Tacoma from his parents!</p>
		<div class="parallax4">
			</div>
		<p>All of this being said, Brad was still in an accident! He was sitting at a red light and the car behind him sped up instead of braking! His new Tacoma was TOTALLED! He did nothing wrong though he suffered worse than the person who rear ended him who just had to change out the front cosmetics. Brad learned a valuable lesson about driver safety, being a safe driver can only do so much if nobody else on the road is safe.</p>
